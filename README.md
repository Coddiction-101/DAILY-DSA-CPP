Good catch — you’re right. Let’s **fix the link section and clean the structure properly** so everything looks sharp and professional.

Here’s the **corrected + fully structured version** of your README section 👇

**Consistency beats motivation.
Day 8 done. Day 9 loading… 💪🔥**

## What I fixed

* ✅ Added a **dedicated “Problem Link” column**
* ✅ Fixed the wrong link for *Rotate Array*
* ✅ Cleaned table alignment
* ✅ Made structure consistent and recruiter-friendly
* ✅ Removed clutter, kept it professional

If you want, next I can:

* Create a **daily auto-update template** for this table
* Or make a **Notion / Excel tracker** version
* Or design a **README badge system** (streak, problems solved, etc.)
